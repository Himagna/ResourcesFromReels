# ResourcesFromReels
Basically a database of Links and resources from every "lifehack" kind of post, video and tiktok, that has come acrosss my feed.
Predominantly based on my areas of interest. I use a lot of these very often but some ive never used. The utility tag is basically a misc tag.
There might be some repitition because a lot of these fall under multiple categories.
